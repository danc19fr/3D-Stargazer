3D-Stargazer	1/29/2022	Dan Cooper

The purpose of this app is to visualize the stars in three dimensions. 	It is for exploring the sky and learning the relationship between brightness and distance. 	It is not a planetarium type app, nor a game, but somewhere in between. It is meant to run on an Android phone or tablet.

3D Stargazer allows viewing the sky as a 3D image. Anaglyph, parallel, and cross-eye images are supported. The sky can be scanned by pan and tilt (RA and DEC). Warp moves the viewer into the sky. Pan and tilt can show the sky from this new location. The brightness of stars is shown relative to the location in space. Star names, constellation lines, and constellation names can be shown.
