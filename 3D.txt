It looks like the 3D part is easy. I ordered a VR phone viewer for $10 and 50 red-cyan viewers for $8. GitHub has several 3D libraries for Android. All we have to do create left and right images and interface to the library. I will give red-cyan viewers to all the kids at Casper AeroLab. We can view some really cool panoramic images from Mars, taken by the Spirit and Opportunity rovers.

The first thing is to come up to speed on Android Studio and GitHub.

There are  a bunch of ways to view 3D. Anaglyph (red-green) uses the whole screen and the cheapest viewer ($0.16). Parallel uses half the screen for each image and needs a viewer. I already have a mirror viewer that works for that. The lens-based viewer I ordered gives a bigger image. Cross-eye swaps the images. You can view it without a viewer, but it is less comfortable and gives a small image. You can use your hands to frame it so each eye sees the only the correct image. The 3D libraries let you choose any of these methods.
