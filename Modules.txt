1/2/2022	Dan Cooper

Overview
	The purpose of this app is to visualize the stars in three dimensions.
	It is for exploring and learning the relationship between brightness and distance.
	It is not a planetarium type app, nor a game, but somewhere in between.

Hardware
	Android phone or tablet

Programming environment
	Programming will be done in Android Studio.
	The project will managed and archived in GitHub.

	Libraries needed
		3D rendering
			full screen
				anaglyph
				scroll x offset
			split screen
				parallel
				cross-eye
		Math
		Touch screen
		Mouse
		Graphics
			point (size, style, size, color)

			horizontal, top and bottom of screen
			vertical, right and left of screen
		tap in center to toggle scroll bars and buttons on display
		pinch and zoom to change display scale
	select display mode
		3D mode
		show constellation lines

		show star names
		background color or image
	scroll
		pan (rotate in x, y)
		tilt(rotate in y, z)
		zoom (reduce size of window)
			+X = The direction of the vernal equinox (at epoch 2000).
			+Y = The direction of R.A. 6 hours, declination 0 degrees.
			+Z = Towards the north celestial pole.
		warp (move forward into star field)

Build tables
	This module runs on a PC and is not included in the app.
	It can done in a spreadsheet.
		stars[number_of_stars][fields]
			This table is abstracted from hygdata_v3, 119616 stars
			fields
				star_name (string)
				constellation_abbreviation (string)
				absolute_magnitude (float)
				coordinates[3] (double)
				color_index (int)
		constellations[number_of_constellations][fields]
			fields
				constellation_name (string)
				constellation_abbreviation (string)
				label_coordinates[3] (double)				
		lines[number_of_lines][fields]
			constellation_abbreviation (string)
			star1 (int)
			star2 (int)
