Overview
	The purpose of this app is to visualize the stars in three dimensions.
	It is for exploring and learning the relationship between brightness and distance.
	It is not a planetarium type app, nor a game, but somewhere in between.

Hardware
	Android phone or tablet

Programming environment
	Programming will be done in Android Studio.
	The project will managed and archived in GitHub.
	Libraries needed
		3D rendering
			full screen
				anaglyph
				scroll x offset
			split screen
				parallel
				cross-eye
		Math
		Touch screen
		Mouse
		Graphics
			point (size, style, size, color)
			line (x1, y1, x2, y2, style, width, color)
			background (color or image)

User Interface
	Mouse input
		scroll bars and buttons
			right button to toggle scroll bars and buttons on display
			left button to click or scroll
			wheel to scroll last selected scroll bar
	Touch screen input
		fixed scroll regions
			horizontal, top and bottom of screen
			vertical, right and left of screen
		tap in center to toggle scroll bars and buttons on display
		pinch and zoom to change display scale
	select display mode
		3D mode
		show constellation lines
		show constellation names
		show star names
		background color or image

Rotation and translation
	order of operations: rotate, offset, scale
	inputs
		axis_values[3], axes_to_rotate[2], offsets[3], scale
	outsputs
		axis_values[3]

Brightness
	inputs
		axis_values[3] (double)
		absolute_magnitude (float)
	outputs
		distance (double)
		apparent_magnitude (float)

Field of view
	hardware parameters
		screen dimensions[2] (float) ; inches or cm
		screen pixels[2] (int)
		interpupillary distance (float)
		distance to screen (float)
	functions
		projection
			inputs
				axis_values[3] (double)
				zoom (float)
			outputs
				screen position[2] (int)

Build tables
	This module runs on a PC and is not included in the app.
	It can be Android code run in an emulator or any other language including a spreadsheet.
		stars[number_of_stars][fields]
			This table is abstracted from hygdata_v3, 119616 stars
			fields
				star_name (string)
				constellation_abbreviation (string)
				absolute_magnitude (float)
				coordinates[3] (double)
				color_index (int)
		constellations[number_of_constellations][fields]
			fields
				constellation_name (string)
				constellation_abbreviation (string)
				label_coordinates[3] (double)				
		lines[number_of_lines][fields]
			constellation_abbreviation (string)
			star1 (int)
			star2 (int)
